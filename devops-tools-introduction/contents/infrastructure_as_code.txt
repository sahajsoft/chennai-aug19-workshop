Context setting:
    Talk about devops before automation and then talk about current world with automated devops using IaC tools

Devops before automation:
    To deploy app on a server,
    - Get servers
    - Setup server configuration like networking, create route tables
    - Install required softwares, configure software like programming language versions
    - Install databases if required

    All above are 'Preparation of server to run applications'

    This was usually done manually by system admins -> Non efficient, time consuming, prone to errors

    Maintenance nightmare:
        - Updating programming language versions
        - Deploying new releases of the application
        - Database backups / updates
        - Disaster recovery
    
    Environments - typically dev / test, and prod
        - Increased effort to do the same maintenance for all Environments


Devops after automation:
    All of above Preparation and maintenance tasks are automated with IaC

IaC tools: 
    Ansible, Terraform, Cloudformation, Puppet, etc.

Why so many tools?
    No 1 tool for all purposes, each tool can do part of the automation

Categories in devops automation - 3 Categories
    1. Provisioning of infrastructure
        - Spinning up new servers
        - Network configuration
        - API gateways and load balancers creation
    
    2. Configuration of provisioned infrastructure
        - Installing applications on servers
        - Managing applications
        - Installing required language, database to prepare the infrastructure to deploy the application
    
    3. Deploying apps on provisioned infrastructure
    

Hint about how categories (2) and (3) are merged together with docker - Docker image packages all required components to run the app along with the application
    So after (1), we only need to install docker runtime to run docker containers


Distinction of phases
    A. Provisioning infrastructure and configuring infrastructure (Initial setup)
    B. Adjustments to infrastructure, adding / removing servers, network config, etc. (Maintenance)
    C. Installation of required softwares and configuring them (Initial setup)
    D. Updating softwares, reconfiguring them as requirements change (Maintenance)

Differences in IaC tools
    - Automate tasks in different categories for different phases of devops
    - Use combination of more than 1 tool

    Terraform is strong in A, B, C. Not so strong in maintenance of softwares
    
    Ansible, Chef, Puppet are strong in C, D, and they can also do B. Not for provisioning infrastructure

Common example of usage of tools
    Terraform for A, B
    Ansible for C, D

Other differences in IaC tools
    - Declarative vs Procedural

    Procedural 
        Step by step instructions like Create Server, Add Server, etc.

    Declarative
        Declare what you want as end result like 2 Servers


    - Mutable vs Immutable
    
    Mutable
        Can make change to created servers, network setup, etc
    
    Immutable
        Create new and replace old
    
    - Agent vs Agentless
